          Cricket is a popular bat-and-ball game played by two teams of eleven
          players, aiming to score the most runs by batting while the opposing
          team bowls and fields. Originating in England, it is now a global
          sport particularly popular in countries like India, Australia, and the
          West Indies.

            <p>
              The primary goal is to score more runs than the opposing team.
              This is achieved by batting teams hitting the ball and running
              between wickets, while the fielding team tries to dismiss the
              batters and restrict scoring.
