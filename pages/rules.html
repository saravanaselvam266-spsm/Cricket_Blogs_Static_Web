        <p>
          Cricket is a two-team sport where one side bats to score runs and the
          other bowls and fields to prevent them, with each team having a turn
          (an inning) at both batting and fielding to score the most runs.

            <p>
              Cricket is played on an oval field with a rectangular pitch at the
              center. <br />At each end of the pitch are wickets, consisting of
              three stumps with <br />two bails balanced on top.

                <strong>Batting:</strong>Two batsmen are on the field, one at
                each wicket. The striker's goal is to hit the ball and score
                runs.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Bowling:</strong>A bowler from the fielding team
                delivers the ball to the striker's wicket.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Fielding:</strong> The other players on the bowling team
                are fielders, positioned to prevent runs and catch the ball.

            <p>
              Batsmen score one run for each time they run and swap places
              between the wickets. A ball hit to the boundary along the ground
              is worth four runs. A ball hit over the boundary without bouncing
              is worth six runs.

              While the ball hit the stump it's out. <br / >Fielders catch the
              ball means it's also out.<br />
              The wicket-keeper hits the stumps with the ball while the batsman
              is outside their crease and the ball isn't a wide.
